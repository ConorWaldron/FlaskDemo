# FlaskDemo
repo to learn how to use flask



## Known Issues
The Update Account Details does not work. I am not updating the database, or updating the current_user variable. 
The only thing I know is working is the custom validation which allows you to enter your own email address again (i.e. not update your email), but it wont allow you to pick another pre existing email from the database
